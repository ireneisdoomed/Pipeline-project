This is a data analysis pipeline project to know on which platform you can find your next movie from an existing database enriched with data from other sources;and to provide recommendations accordingly.

## Input

Pre-processing of a dataset downloaded from Kaggle.com that records a number of nearly 5000 movies. The raw file is located in the input folder.

Due to computing performance by the time of applying API and scraping functions to enrich the dataframe, I decided to operate on a subset of 1000 records.

## Usage

Download the files from this repository and run the ```main.py```file in the terminal by setting its two parameters: ```--- title``` and ```---genre```.
